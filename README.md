# Welcome to the Jailbreak Trading Bot

This is a **project** started by me, the **Jailbreak | TradingBot**.
I've started this project about a week ago, the ultimate goal of this project is to help everyone trade their items up to better and higher valued items.

## How?
The trading bot automatically hops to different trading-servers, and automatically reads user's messages and needs, and sends trades depending on those messages.

## Example:
If I run the bot, switch to a server, and there's a person saying 'LF / Looking for Beignet'
It'll automatically send that person a trade request, trading a beignet.
The trade-bot works with **daily updated** values, to **make sure** you earn profits!
The base profit you'll earn is 20%, but you can make this amount higher in the config after opening the bot.

It'll automatically put in a Beignet, and it'll check if the other person puts in more value, and in the config you can also put in how many items that person should max put in the trading menu.
It'll automatically accept, if that person puts 20% or more value in, and when he removed value, the bot will un-accept the trade, looking for other people.

## Why have I chosen to make it work this way?
People that are looking for specific items/cars, are more likely to over-pay for your items!
If I were to be desperate for a Torpedo, I would be giving more than what the torpedo is worth, as I'm really desperate for one.

## Thanks for using this bot, this is **FREE** for now, but it'll be paid soon!!!
It'll be paid once I notice many people are using it.
I've tested the bot well, and will soon make a show-case video of all the profits I've made.


## **Does it bypass ByFron?**
Yes, it's got a modern way of injecting into the new 64-bit Roblox process.

## **Is it reliable?**
I've been testing for 3 days so far, 72 hours.
I noticed 1 trade I wasn't that happy with, which was mostly due to the fact that I did not want hyperchromes as accept, but there is now a config option to remove certain items.
So far, I went from 12 million value, to 90 million value.

## **When will this project become paid?**
Once I notice that too many people are using this bot, I'll make it paid.
But I guarantee free trial-keys once it turns paid, so you can test out the bot before purchasing it!

## **What will the payment options be?**
I will be accepting PayPal, Crypto, Skrill, Neteller, robux and jailbreak value.

## **My question isn't in this list**
DM me, my dm's are open for anyone.
